An operating system is the most important software that runs on a computer. It manages the computer's memory and processes, as well as all of its software and hardware. It also allows you to communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the computer's language. Without an operating system, a computer is useless.

## Why use an operating system?

An operating system brings powerful benefits to computer software and software development. Without an operating system, every application would need to include its own UI, as well as the comprehensive code needed to handle all low-level functionality of the underlying computer, such as disk storage, network interfaces and so on. Considering the vast array of underlying hardware available, this would vastly bloat the size of every application and make software development impractical.

Instead, many common tasks, such as sending a network packet or displaying text on a standard output device, such as a display, can be offloaded to system software that serves as an intermediary between the applications and the hardware. The system software provides a consistent and repeatable way for applications to interact with the hardware without the applications needing to know any details about the hardware.

As long as each application accesses the same resources and services in the same way, that system software -- the operating system -- can service almost any number of applications. This vastly reduces the amount of time and coding required to develop and debug an application, while ensuring that users can control, configure and manage the system hardware through a common and well-understood interface.

## Types of operating systems

Operating systems usually come pre-loaded on any computer you buy. Most people use the operating system that comes with their computer, but it's possible to upgrade or even change operating systems. The three most common operating systems for personal computers are Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Modern operating systems use a graphical user interface, or GUI (pronounced gooey). A GUI lets you use your mouse to click icons, buttons, and menus, and everything is clearly displayed on the screen using a combination of graphics and text

Each operating system's GUI has a different look and feel, so if you switch to a different operating system it may seem unfamiliar at first. However, modern operating systems are designed to be easy to use, and most of the basic principles are the same.

##  Functions of Operating System

* **Process management:** Process management helps OS to create and delete processes. It also provides mechanisms for synchronization and communication among processes.
* **Memory management:** Memory management module performs the task of allocation and de-allocation of memory space to programs in need of this resources.
* **File management:** It manages all the file-related activities such as organization storage, retrieval, naming, sharing, and protection of files.
* **Device Management:** Device management keeps tracks of all devices. This module also responsible for this task is known as the I/O controller. It also performs the task of allocation and de-allocation of the devices.
* **I/O System Management:** One of the main objects of any OS is to hide the peculiarities of that hardware devices from the user.
* **Secondary-Storage Management:** Systems have several levels of storage which includes primary storage, secondary storage, and cache storage. Instructions and data must be stored in primary storage or cache so that a running program can reference it.
* **Security:** Security module protects the data and information of a computer system against malware threat and authorized access.
* **Command interpretation:** This module is interpreting commands given by the and acting system resources to process that commands.
* **Networking:** A distributed system is a group of processors which do not share memory, hardware devices, or a clock. The processors communicate with one another through the network.
* **Job accounting:** Keeping track of time & resource used by various job and users.
* **Communication management:** Coordination and assignment of compilers, interpreters, and another software resource of the various users of the computer systems.

## Features of Operating System (OS)

**_Here is a list important features of OS:_**

* Protected and supervisor mode
* Allows disk access and file systems Device drivers Networking Security
* Program Execution
* Memory management Virtual Memory Multitasking
* Handling I/O operations
* Manipulation of the file system
* Error Detection and handling
* Resource allocation
* Information and Resource Protection

## Advantage of Operating System

* Allows you to hide details of hardware by creating an abstraction
* Easy to use with a GUI
* Offers an environment in which a user may execute programs/applications
* The operating system must make sure that the computer system convenient to use
* Operating System acts as an intermediary among applications and the hardware components
* It provides the computer system resources with easy to use format
* Acts as an intermediator between all hardware’s and software’s of the system

## Disadvantages of Operating System

* If any issue occurs in OS, you may lose all the contents which have been stored in your system
* Operating system’s software is quite expensive for small size organization which adds burden on them. Example Windows
* It is never entirely secure as a threat can occur at any time
